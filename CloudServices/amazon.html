        <h2 class="subheading">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</h2>
    <p>Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the 
    basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking
    features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
    Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility 
    and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing 
    IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

       <h2 class="subheading"> About Amazon Web Services</h2>
       
       <p>Known commonly as cloud computing nowadays, web services in the form 
       of IT infrastructure services began to be offered by Amazon in 2006. These 
       are known as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

       AWS provides a low-cost, scalable and highly reliable infrastructure platform 
       in the cloud. This has been adopted by thousands of businesses globally. 
       Australia, the US, Japan, Europe, Singapore and Brazil are among the data 
       center locations. The locations are widespread to make sure the system is 
       robust and secured against the impact of outages or other such problems.</p>
       
       <p>In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services 
       to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. 
       One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front 
       capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. 
       With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT 
       infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds 
       or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.
        Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure
        platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries 
        around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, 
        Japan, and Australia, customers across all industries are taking advantage of AWS</p>
