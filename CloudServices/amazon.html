       <h2 class="subheading"> About Amazon Cloud Services</h2>
       
       <p>Known commonly as cloud computing nowadays, web services in the form 
       of IT infrastructure services began to be offered by Amazon in 2006. These 
       are known as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

       AWS provides a low-cost, scalable and highly reliable infrastructure platform 
       in the cloud. This has been adopted by thousands of businesses globally. 
       Australia, the US, Japan, Europe, Singapore and Brazil are among the data 
       center locations. The locations are widespread to make sure the system is 
       robust and secured against the impact of outages or other such problems.
       
       <br/>

       The AWS bouquet of services includes the following:
       <br/>
        <ul>
       <li>Simple Storage Service: This covers archiving of application programs and 
       data and online backup. The service is low cost, high speed and scalable.</li>
       
       <li>CloudDrive: This lets users utilize web connected devices to access and 
       upload photos, music, documents and videos. They can also use their devices 
       to stream music.</li>
       
       <li>RedShift: The service is designed for analytic workloads connecting with 
       business intelligence tools and standard SQL based clients. It is a data 
       warehouse service that handles petabyte-scale data.</li>
       
       <li>CloudSearch: is used for the integration of customized search capabilities 
       and is a scalable search service.</li>
       
       <li>Mechanical Turk: This lets developers incorporate human intelligence in 
       remote procedure calls. It is an application program interface (API) that
       uses a human network to carry out tasks that computers are not suitable for.</li>
       
       <li>Dynamo Database: is a NoSQL database which is fully managed and known for 
       its scalability and low latencies.</li>

       load by speeding up dynamic web applications. Memcached is an open source and 
       high performing distributed memory object caching system. ElastiCache is a fully 
       managed caching service.</li>
       
       <li>Elastic Compute Cloud: can be used as an unlimited number of virtual machines 
       and lets business subscribers run app programs.</li> 
       
       </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">What are the Advantages of Amazon Cloud?</h2>
        
<h3>Security</h3>

SAS 70 Type II, PCI DSS Level 1, HIPAA, FISMA Moderate and ISO 27001 are among the 
well-recognized certifications that AWS has. It is a durable and secure technology 
platform. To ensure the safety and integrity of your data, Amazon's data centers 
and services have several layers of physical and operational security.
AWS conducts regular audits to ensure its infrastructural security.
It has implemented best practices in security and also provides documentation 
on how to deploy the security features. It ensures the availability, integrity 
and confidentiality of your data and provides end to end privacy and 'end to end'
security.

<h3>Cost-Effectiveness</h3>

<p>There are no long-term commitments or upfront expenses as AWS provides low and 
pay as you go pricing. Amazon passes the benefits of cost saving on to customers 
in the form of lower prices as it manages and builds global infrastructure at scale.</p>


<p>You consume only as much storage or computing power as required. No upfront investment 
or minimum expenditure is required. Generally, it is not easy to predict the requirements 
for the resources. So, you might allocate fewer resources than required and impact customer 
satisfaction or you might allocate excessive resources and not be able to maximize return 
on investment (ROI).</p>


<p>The flexibility of cloud can help to achieve the correct balance. You can terminate 
your relationship with AWS whenever you want to, scale down or scale up as required and 
have a fully self-service experience online. You can get new resources nearly at once. 
Reduce costs and drive revenues by taking on new opportunities as the cloud enables you 
to respond rapidly to changes small or large.
You are not limited to a set amount of computing resources, bandwidth or storage.</p>

<h3>Flexibility and Openness</h3>

<p>AWS is a platform agnostic to operating systems and languages. You select the programming 
model or development platform that can be the most beneficial for your business. You can 
select the services (one or more) you want to use and also select how to use them. The 
flexibility lets you concentrate on innovation rather than infrastructure.
You can use the programming languages, architectures, operating systems and databases 
you are familiar with. In this manner, there won’t be any need for your IT personnel to 
pick up new skills and the overall time to market and productivity will improve.</p>

<p>You need to make substantial investments in operating systems, programming languages 
and new architectures while using traditional models of IT solutions delivery. You may 
not be able to respond quickly to opportunities and changing markets and your business 
may slow down owing to the time taken to adapt to new technologies, although the investments are valuable.
When the opportunity for innovation appears, you don’t want to have to deal with prolonged 
processes for procurement or support legacy apps and infrastructure. You want to move quickly.
It is cost-effective and easy to migrate legacy apps to the cloud. You don’t have to rewrite 
apps and can utilize advanced capabilities of computing to move legacy apps to AWS cloud.</p>

<p>There is not much difference between development of apps using hardware resources that 
already exist and developing apps on AWS. You can use the services for specific needs 
separately or together as a platform, as AWS provides a virtual and flexible IT 
infrastructure. From offsite data backups to batch processing to full web apps, AWS 
runs them all.You can migrate discrete components of legacy apps to move SOA-based solutions to the 
cloud. Generally, these components are self-contained apps with not many internal 
dependencies.</p>

<p>Large organizations usually run pieces of apps in the cloud and other pieces 
in their own data centers. Gradually, these organizations begin to value the 
benefits and transition more projects to the cloud. Many see the distinctive 
advantage of the AWS cloud and include it in their IT mix forever.
Instead of the long time it takes to plan, hire, budget, operate, procure, 
deploy and set up for a new project, you can begin deployment immediately when 
you sign up for AWS as you have the equivalent of thousands of servers through 
the cloud. AWS makes it easy to be productive, once you get started, whether you 
want to host a production solution or prototype an app. A number of customers 
improve their time to market on account of the flexibility that AWS offers.</p>

<h3>Elasticity and Agility</h3>

AWS lets you iterate, experiment and innovate quickly through its huge global cloud 
infrastructure. You can quickly scale up or scale down on the basis of demand. 
You can also use new apps, rather than wait for months for hardware.
So, you can swiftly subtract or add resources in accordance with customer demand 
and manage costs more effectively. You can also avoid resource provisioning upfront 
for projects with short lifetimes and variable consumption rates.

You have to pay only for as much as you use, regardless of whether you deploy 
thousands of virtual servers or only one and whether you need them 24/7 or only a
few hours daily.Elasticity and scalability were equated with infrastructure and 
investment in traditional IT organizations. Elasticity and scalability provide 
an opportunity for better ROI and savings in the cloud.

In the context of AWS, the ability to scale computing resources downwards or upwards 
without difficulty and with very little friction is known as elasticity. It helps to 
not provision resources upfront for projects with short lifetimes or variable consumption rates.
You can use AWS to allot resources through API calls, in place of buying hardware, 
setting it up and maintaining it to allot resources to apps.
A traditional IT organization would find it difficult to handle if traffic increased 
several times in a short period. You have to be sure that your existing infrastructure 
can handle a sudden increase in traffic and that such an increase will not affect normal 
operations of the business. Auto scaling and elastic load balancing can scale up AWS cloud 
based resources automatically in case of unforeseen increase in demand and also scale them down if demand gets reduced.

The AWS cloud also proves useful for jobs recurring at regular intervals, jobs that are ‘mission critical’ and jobs in the short term.

<h3>Experience</h3>

You can benefit from the skills and infrastructure management capabilities of AWS that it continues to innovate and improve upon. Amazon has more than 15 years of experience in delivering global infrastructure at a large scale.
