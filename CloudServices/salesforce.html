       <h2 class="subheading">Software as a Service (SaaS):</h2>
       
       
       <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which 
       a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers 
       over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, 
       alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>
       
       <p>SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on 
       their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense 
       of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software 
       licensing, installation and support. </p>
       
       
       <h2 class="subheading">About Salesforce</h2>

       <p>Salesforce is much more than just a CRM solution. It brings together all 
       your customer information in a single, integrated platform that enables you 
       to build a customer-centred business from marketing right through to sales, 
       customer service and business analysis. This gives you more complete understanding 
       of your customers to drive your business&apos;s success. That’s why we call it the 
       Customer Success Platform.</p>
       
    <p>Innovative solutions like Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud work seamlessly 
    with Sales Cloud to give you a 360-degree view of your customers; improving 
    customer service, generating more leads, and increasing sales. Salesforce Platform 
    helps you create apps at the speed of Lightning, while solutions like IoT Cloud and 
    Wave Analytics allow you to harness the power of your data.</p>
    
    <h2 class="subheading">Benefits of Salesforce</h2>
    
    <h3>Improved Informational Organization</h3>

    alt="Organization" height="200px" width="175px">
    
    <p>The more you know about your customers, the better you&apos;ll be able to provide 
    them with the kind of positive experience that really pays off. Everything that 
    they do, and every interaction that they have with your organization needs to be 
    identified, documented, and recorded. </p>
    
    <h2>CRM for Enhanced Communication</h2>
    <img src="https://png.icons8.com/ios/1600/communication.png"
    alt="Communication" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>As mentioned above, CRM makes it possible for any employee to provide the same high 
    level of service, by having access to the same customer data. After all, even if 
    your customers have a single, main point of contact, there&apos;s a good chance that at 
    some point that contact may not be available, and the client will be forced to have
    to work with someone new. </p>
    <p>When that happens, many customers face the unhappy prospect 
    of having to &apos;start fresh&apos; with someone who doesn&apos;t understand their own unique 
    preferences and issues. CRM does away with this concern, by making detailed customer 
    information communicable to whomever might need it. </p>
    
    <h2>CRM Improves Your Customer Service</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logistics/256/Customer_Support-512.png"
    alt="customer service" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>Your time is valuable, but so is your customers’ time. And, should your customers 
    experience a problem that needs resolution, they&apos;re going to be unhappy unless 
    that problem can be taken care of quickly. With CRM, as soon as a customer contacts 
    your company, your representatives will be able to retrieve all available activity 
    concerning past purchases, preferences, and anything else that might assist them in 
    finding a solution. </p>
    
    <h2>Automation of Everyday Tasks</h2>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.fusesystems.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/automation-icon.png"
    alt="Automation" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>Completing a sale is never as easy as just getting a customer to agree to commit.
    Along with the surface details of any sale, there are hundreds of smaller tasks 
    that must be completed in order for everything to function properly. Forms need 
    to be filled out, reports need to be sent, legal issues need to be addressed—these 
    ancillary chores are a time consuming, yet vital aspect of the sales process. </p>
    
    <p>The best CRM systems are designed to take the burden of many of these tasks from off the shoulders 
    of your employees, thanks to the magic of automation. This means that your representatives 
    will be able to focus more of their efforts towards closing leads and resolving customer 
    pain points, while the automated CRM system takes care of the details.</p>
    
    <h2>Greater efficiency for multiple teams</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/business-management-1/256/Productivity-512.png"
    alt="efficient" height="150px" width="150px">
    Automatically stored communication allows you to view emails, calendar and phone 
    call details in one easily accessible place. Add that to the ability for multiple 
    teams to access the same information, it simply sky rockets the amount of achievable 
    progress. Sales, marketing, and customer service teams can share valuable information 
    about clients to continue to funnel them down the pipeline to get the desired result 
    of closing a sale, knowledge of new products, or excellent customer service. 
    
    <h2>Improved Analytical Data and Reporting</h2>
    <img src ="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/danger-problems/512/reporting-512.png"
    alt="data" height="200px" width="200px">
    
   <p> Miscalculated data should not be the reason you cannot succeed, with CRM this 
    is no longer a possibility. CRM systems store information in one place which 
    leads to improved analyzing of the data as a whole. Easily integrated with different 
    tools or plugins, you have the ability to generate automatic reports to maximize your 
    time. </p>
