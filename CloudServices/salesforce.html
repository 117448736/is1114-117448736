       <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which 
       a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers 
       over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, 
       alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>
       
       <p>SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on 
       their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense 
       of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software 
       licensing, installation and support. </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Benefits of Salesforce</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h3>Improved Informational Organization</h3></li>
    The more you know about your customers, the better you’ll be able to provide 
    them with the kind of positive experience that really pays off. Everything that 
    they do, and every interaction that they have with your organization needs to be 
    identified, documented, and recorded. To do this, you need to move beyond the sticky-
    notes and disorganized filing cabinets, and start utilizing advanced organizational 
    technology that can not only accurately quantify and categorize data for easy future 
    reference, but also make that data available across departments. Thanks to CRM this 
    all becomes a possibility, it allows you to store a vast list of customers and any 
    important information regarding them. Access to their file is even more convenient 
    than before due to the cloud, so no matter who it is that is helping the customer 
    in question, they’ll have the same actionable data instantly available. This will 
    result in less wasted time for clients and employees.
    
    <li><h3>CRM for Enhanced Communication</h3></li>
    As mentioned above, CRM makes it possible for any employee to provide the same high 
    level of service, by having access to the same customer data. After all, even if 
    your customers have a single, main point of contact, there’s a good chance that at 
    some point that contact may not be available, and the client will be forced to have
    to work with someone new. When that happens, many customers face the unhappy prospect 
    of having to ‘start fresh’ with someone who doesn’t understand their own unique 
    preferences and issues. CRM does away with this concern, by making detailed customer 
    information communicable to whomever might need it. As such, it won’t matter who it 
    is that is currently assisting the client, because they’ll be working from the same 
    information. And given that CRM is cloud-based and accessible from any device with 
    an internet connection, the communication benefits of mobile CRM are not limited to 
    the office.
    
    <li><h3>CRM Improves Your Customer Service</h3></li>
    Your time is valuable, but so is your customers’ time. And, should your customers 
    experience a problem that needs resolution, they’re going to be unhappy unless 
    that problem can be taken care of quickly. With CRM, as soon as a customer contacts 
    your company, your representatives will be able to retrieve all available activity 
    concerning past purchases, preferences, and anything else that might assist them in 
    finding a solution. In many cases, your more experienced representatives, armed with 
    past information and history, will be able to locate a solution within the first few 
    minutes, thanks to an accessible database of potential issues. And, should a solution 
    not be readily apparent, then bringing in other representatives, or even crowdsourcing 
    for answers through customer portals, is a simple matter. With CRM, customer support 
    becomes a walk in the park.
    
    <li><h3>Automation of Everyday Tasks</h3></li>
    Completing a sale is never as easy as just getting a customer to agree to commit.
    Along with the surface details of any sale, there are hundreds of smaller tasks 
    that must be completed in order for everything to function properly. Forms need 
    to be filled out, reports need to be sent, legal issues need to be addressed—these 
    ancillary chores are a time consuming, yet vital aspect of the sales process. The best 
    CRM systems are designed to take the burden of many of these tasks from off the shoulders 
    of your employees, thanks to the magic of automation. This means that your representatives 
    will be able to focus more of their efforts towards closing leads and resolving customer 
    pain points, while the automated CRM system takes care of the details.
    
    <li><h3>Greater efficiency for multiple teams</h3></li>
    Automatically stored communication allows you to view emails, calendar and phone 
    call details in one easily accessible place. Add that to the ability for multiple 
    teams to access the same information, it simply sky rockets the amount of achievable 
    progress. Sales, marketing, and customer service teams can share valuable information 
    about clients to continue to funnel them down the pipeline to get the desired result 
    of closing a sale, knowledge of new products, or excellent customer service. Every 
    department can now tag team to get the right information to the right individual. 
    With this new found ease, teams can seamlessly work together to improve the bottom line.
    
    <li><h3>Improved Analytical Data and Reporting</h3></li>
    Miscalculated data should not be the reason you cannot succeed, with CRM this 
    is no longer a possibility. CRM systems store information in one place which 
    leads to improved analyzing of the data as a whole. Easily integrated with different 
    tools or plugins, you have the ability to generate automatic reports to maximize your 
    time. Personalize your dashboard views to quickly locate information needed such as 
    customer information, sales goals, and performance reports to reach untapped opportunities.
    With better reporting data you can make resourceful and effective decisions to reap the 
    rewards in customer loyalty and long run profitability.
