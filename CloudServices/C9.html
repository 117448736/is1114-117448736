          <h2 class="subheading>">Platform as a Service(PaaS):</h2>
          
          <p>Cloud platform services, or Platform as a Service (PaaS), are used for 
          , and other development, while providing cloud components to software.
          What developers gain with PaaS is a framework they can build upon to 
          develop or customize applications. PaaS makes the development, testing, 
          and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective. With 
          this technology, enterprise operations, or a third-party provider, can 
          manage OSes, virtualization, servers, storage, networking, and the PaaS 
          software itself. Developers, however, manage the applications.</p>

        <p>Enterprise PaaS provides line-of-business software developers a self-service 
        portal for managing computing infrastructure from centralized IT operations 
        and the platforms that are installed on top of the hardware. The enterprise 
        PaaS can be delivered through a hybrid model that uses both public IaaS and 
        on-premise infrastructure or as a pure private PaaS that only uses the latter.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">About Cloud 9</h2>
       <p>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that 
       lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes 
       a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential 
       tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and 
       more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine 
       to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on 
       your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected 
       machine. Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for developing serverless 
       applications allowing you to easily define resources, debug, and switch between 
       local and remote execution of serverless applications. With Cloud9, you can 
       quickly share your development environment with your team, allowing you to 
       pair program and track each other's inputs in real-time.</p>

       <h3>Fully-featured Editor</h3>
       <img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/colicon/24/editor_document_file_edit_pen_pencil_2-512.png"
       alt="editor" height="125px" width="125px">
    <p>AWS Cloud9 includes a browser-based editor that makes it easy to write, run, and 
    debug your projects. As you type, code completion and code hinting suggestions appear 
    in the editor, helping you code faster and avoid errors. Code completion is based not 
    only on the identifiers within your files but also on standard libraries. The editor 
    also enables you to fully customize your view. You can adjust your panels in any 
    direction with a simple drag-and-drop action.</p>
    
    <h3>Broad Selection of Run Configurations</h3>

        height="125px" width="125px">
    <p>AWS Cloud9 supports over 40 programming languages and application types including JavaScript, 
    Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and C++. With Cloud9, you can either choose from the default run 
    configurations or define custom configurations by specifying environment variables, filenames, 
    command line options, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Integrated Debugger</h3>

    alt="tools" height="125px" width="125px">
    <p>AWS Cloud9 allows you to easily build serverless applications by providing an integrated experience to get 
    started, write, and debug serverless application code. The Cloud9 development environment is pre-packaged with SDKs, 
    tools, and libraries needed for serverless application development. Cloud9 also supports the Serverless Application Model 
    (SAM) so you can use SAM templates in Cloud9 to provide a simplified way of defining resources for your serverless applications. 
    Additionally, Cloud9 allows you to edit and debug AWS Lambda functions locally, which eliminates the need to upload your code 
    to the Lambda console for debugging.</p>
    
    <h3>Connectivity to Any Linux Server Platform</h3>
    <img src="https://www.cloudninerealtime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ah-connectivity-icon.png"
    alt="connectivity" height="125px" width="125px">
    <p>You have the flexibility to run AWS Cloud9 development environments on a managed Amazon EC2 Linux instance or any Linux 
    server that you are using today. You can just choose the SSH connectivity option during Cloud9 setup when connecting to 
    your own Linux server that could be running anywhere including AWS, on-premises, or any other cloud provider.</p>
