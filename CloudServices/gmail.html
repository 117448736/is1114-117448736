       <h2 class="subheading">Communication as a Service(CaaS):</h2>
       </div>
       
       <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications 
       solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can 
       include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), 
       collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
       CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>
       
       <p>The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management 
       and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses to 
       selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, 
       as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and 
       ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short 
       of current demand</p>
       
       <h2 class="subheading">About Gmail:</h2>
       
       <p>Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. 
       Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize
       email content through POP or IMAP protocols. Gmail started as a limited beta 
       release on April 1, 2004, and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.</p>
       
       <p>mail makes email easy. With 2000 megabytes of free storage, you never
       need to throw messages away. And with a powerful built-in Google search 
       engine, you no longer need to set up folders, file your mail, or remember 
       where you stored your messages. Just search for what you want. You'll not 
       only find the message you have in mind, but all the other messages that are 
       part of the same conversation - arranged in chronological order so you can 
       easily put everything in context.</p>
       
       
       <h2 class="subheading">Advantages of Gmail:</h2>
       
       <h3>Huge storage space</h3>

    <p>The first is that you are able to get a great deal of storage space, much more 
    than you may be able to get if you were using a client program for your emails. 
    Currently, Gmail for business offers 25Gb of storage space which means that it is 
    possible to store a large number of email messages or messages containing large 
    files rather than being limited by storage space on a corporate server or hard drive.</p>
    
    <h3>Online anywhere access</h3>
    
    <p>One that comes instantly to mind is the fact that it can be accessed 
    anywhere where there is internet access. On a server-based email client 
    program you may find that it becomes difficult to access email. Some people 
    find that when they access an online version of their messages they lack the 
    ability to work with them as easily as if they had accessed them from their 
    regular computer.</p>
    
    <h3>Cheaper and less manpower to maintain:</h3>
    
    <p>Gmail is low cost, zero maintenance, and data storage “in the cloud,” which 
    means your email, documents, and events are always available anywhere you can 
    get online with a web browser. You don’t need an IT system administrator to 
    create accounts and give users access to services; you can do that all yourself 
    using Google Apps’ dashboard. You don’t have to worry about data backup (it’s 
    all stored on Google’s servers), hitting email account storage limits (Gmail’s 
    up to 7GB of storage per user now), or futzing with VPNs, firewalls, or specific 
    software. At any time you can choose to switch to another provider and take your 
    domain name with you, which means you don’t have to change your email address if 
    you decide Google Apps isn’t working for you.</p>
    
    <h3>Synchronisation with Outlook:</h3>
       
    <p>Your Gmail business email account can be synced with MS Outlook and BlackBerry, 
    Android and iPhone, familiar platforms that are widely used by many business 
    professionals. Being able to quickly set up access to your email program is 
    a huge benefit when trying to utilize technology such as Smartphone devices.</p>
    
    <h3>Easy search and organisation</h3>
    
    <p>There are also a number of different features that allow you to organize your 
    emails. One exciting feature allows you to add Hotmail and Yahoo accounts to 
    your Gmail account so that you are able to manage all of your emails from 
    one account.</p>
    
    <h3>Security of data</h3>
    
    <p>Your business Gmail account is backed up on the Google platform which gives 
    it guarantee of service and uptime. You access your data over a secured SSL-encrypted 
    connection so no one can access your info.</p>
