Cloud storage works through data center virtualization, providing end users and 
applications with a virtual storage architecture that is scalable according to 
application requirements. In general, cloud storage operates through a web-based 
API that is remotely implemented through its interaction with the client 
application's in-house cloud storage infrastructure for input/output (I/O) 
and read/write (R/W) operations.
When delivered through a public service provider, cloud storage is known as 
utility storage. Private cloud storage provides the same scalability, flexibility 
and storage mechanism with restricted or non-public access

     <h2 class ="subheading">Benefits of Cloud Storage</h2>
     <ol>
         <li> Flexibility

Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth 
demands. If your needs increase it’s easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing 
on the service’s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the 
flexibility is baked into the service. This level of agility can give businesses
using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors – it’s not surprising 
that CIOs and IT Directors rank ‘operational agility’ as a top driver for cloud 
adoption
</li>
<li>Disaster recovery

Businesses of all sizes should be investing in robust disaster recovery, but for 
smaller businesses that lack the required cash and expertise, this is often more 
an ideal than the reality. Cloud is now helping more organisations buck that trend. 
According to Aberdeen Group, small businesses are twice as likely as larger companies
to have implemented cloud-based backup and recovery solutions that save time, avoid 
large up-front investment and roll up third-party expertise as part of the deal
</li>

<li>Automatic software updates

The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off-premise, out of sight 
and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for you and roll out regular 
software updates – including security updates – so you don’t have to worry about
wasting time maintaining the system yourself. Leaving you free to focus on the 
things that matter, like growing your business.
</li>

<li>Capital-expenditure Free

Cloud computing cuts out the high cost of hardware. You simply pay as you go and 
enjoy a subscription-based model that’s kind to your cash flow. Add to that the 
ease of setup and management and suddenly your scary, hairy IT project looks at 
lot friendlier. It’s never been easier to take the first step to cloud adoption.
</li>

<li>Increased collaboration

When your teams can access, edit and share documents anytime, from anywhere, 
they’re able to do more together, and do it better. Cloud-based workflow and file 
sharing apps help them make updates in real time and gives them full visibility 
of their collaborations
