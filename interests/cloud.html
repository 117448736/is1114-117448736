    <h2 align="center">About Cloud Storage</h2>
    <p align = "center" style="font-size:20px">Cloud storage is a service model in which data is maintained, 
    managed, backed up remotely and made available to users over a network (typically the Internet). 
    Users generally pay for their cloud data storage on a per-consumption, monthly rate.
    Although the per-gigabyte cost has been radically driven down, cloud storage providers 
    have added operating expenses that can make the technology more expensive than users 
    bargained for. Cloud security continues to be a concern among users. Providers have 
    tried to deal with those fears by building security capabilities, such as encryption 
    and authentication, into their services.</p>
