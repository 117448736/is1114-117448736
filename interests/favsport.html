        <p align="center">My favourite sport is Rugby. I have been playing rugby since I was six.
            Rugby is a sport which is rapidly increasing in popularity nationaally and 
            globally. Much of the national success can be attributed to the success of both
            the national team and the Irish Provinces.I shall give some information about the 
            sport so as to help people understand the sport better.

        <p>
            The game of rugby was founded when 16-year-old student William Webb Ellis, "with a fine disregard for the 
            rules of football...first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus 
            originating the distinctive feature of the rugby game." Lucky he didn't go 
            to a Comprehensive - he'd have got the shoeing of his life.
            
            Arthur Pell establishes the first team at Cambridge and draws up the 'Cambridge Rules'
            
            However, Webb Ellis is credited with founding the game of rugby, hence
            the World Cup Trophy is called the Web Ellis Trophy

           <p> <b>Lineout:</b> Looks somewhat like a jump-ball in basketball, with both teams lining up opposite each other, 
        but one team then throws the ball down the middle of the tunnel and both sets of players compete by lifting
        a jumper at either side. Line-outs restart play after the ball, or a player carrying it, has gone out of bounds.

           <p> <b>Maul:</b> Occurs when a player carrying the ball is held by one or more opponents, and one or more of the
        ball-carrier&apos;s teammates bind on the ball-carrier. All the players involved are on their feet and moving toward
        a goal line. Open play has ended. If the defending team manage to hold up the attacker for about 30 seconds then

            <p>  <b>Ruck:</b> One or more players from each team, who are on their feet and in contact, close around the ball on the 
        ground. Prior to the ruck when a tackle has been made, the defending team can compete for the ball by supporting
        their body weight and placing their hands.Once a ruck has been formed, players can&apos;t use their hands to get the ball, 
        only their feet.</p>

             <p> <b>Scrum:</b> A contest for the ball involving eight players who bind together and push against the other team&apos;s 
        assembled eight for possession of the ball. Scrums restart play after certain minor infraction such as a knock-on 
        or maul.</p>

        <h3 style="color:crimson">RUGBY POSITIONS AND SCORING</h3>
        <p>Like most sports that didn&apos;t originate in North America, the game of rugby can be difficult to comprehend at first
        glance because of the large number of players involved, the seemingly random calls of the referee, and the wide 
        variety of strategies employed by different teams to score points and get wins.</p>

        </div>
    <h3 style="color:crimson">RUGBY POSITIONS</h3>
    <p>
    A rugby team has 15 positions. Each one wears a specific number and has individual responsibilities:
    <ul style="color:#DC143C">
    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">1 and 3 are the props</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">2 is the hooker</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">4 and 5 are the locks</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">6 and 7 are the flankers</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">8 is, conveniently enough, the eightman</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p/>

    <p>
    This group is collectively referred to as the pack or the forwards. This group's 
    main goal is to win possession of the ball. These players are usually the heavyweights
    of the team, using their bulk and strength to try to overpower their opponents.
    </p>
    
    <p>A rugby team has another group as well — the backs or back line:</p>
    
    <ul style="color:#DC143C">
    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">9 is the scrumhalf</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">10 is the flyhalf</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">11 and 14 are the wings</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">12 and 13 are the inside and outside centers</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff">15 is the fullback</span></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To get a feel for what each player is charged with doing on the rugby pitch.</p>

    
    <h3 style="color:crimson">RUGBY SCORING</h3>
    
    
        
    <p>The aim of rugby is to score more points than the opposition. This is done in 
    four different ways:</p>
    
    <ul style="color:#DC143C">
        
    <li><span style="color:#ffffff"><strong>Try:</strong> The most valuable play is to score a try, which means touching the ball down 
    in the opponent&apos;s in-goal area or on their goal line. Doing so is worth five points 
    and earns that team the right to attempt a conversion kick.</li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff"><strong>Conversion kick:</strong> This kick is worth an additional two points. The conversion kick 
    is taken from a spot in line with where the ball was originally grounded, so scoring 
    as close to the posts as possible is best.</li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff"><strong>Penalty kick:</strong> Penalties for various infractions can be used to take a kick at goal, 
    which is worth three points.</li>

    <li><span style="color:#ffffff"><strong>Dropped goal:</strong> A dropped goal, which occurs when the player drops the ball on the 
    ground and then kicks it just as it bounces, is worth three points if it goes through 
    the uprights.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3 style="color:crimson">TACKLING THE LAWS OF RUGBY</h3>
    <div>
    <p>
    Rugby is governed by laws, not rules. The laws of the game are designed to produce an 
    entertaining and free-flowing contest for possession in an attempt to score the most points.</p>

    <p>The laws of rugby are constantly evolving and are the same all over the world, wherever 
    the game is played. In general, the laws governing play are straightforward about what’s allowed, 
    but three crucial parts can be somewhat confusing: the tackle situation, advantage, and offsides:</p>

    <p>In a nutshell, when a tackle is made in rugby the requirements are that the tackler releases 
    the tackled player, who then releases the ball so that players who are on their feet can use it.</p>

    <p>Advantage simply means that when one team makes an error the other team can try to capitalize 
    on it, instead of the referee immediately stopping the action. If the players can’t capitalize 
    on the error, play restarts where the original mistake took place.</p>

    <p>Specific offsides laws exist for different phases of play, but essentially players can&apos;t be 
    involved if they&apos;re in front of a teammate who last played the ball or are behind the ball when 
    the opposition has it.
